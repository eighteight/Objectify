"Objectify" plugin for CINEMA 4D
=============
Very much work in progress!

This an attempt to integrate pcl pointcloud library into Cinema 4D. Currently the intent is to take a bunch of points and run a fast surface reconstruction from pcl to produce a polygonal object

##Compability
The plugin has been compiled with the R14 sdk and has only been tested with C4D R14.

##Installation
Unzip the folder to your CINEMA/plugins/ folder and restart CINEMA.


##Usage
Drop a multisegmented spline into the Object field -- it should reconstruct the surface from the cross section of these segements
